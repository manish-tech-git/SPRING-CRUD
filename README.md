# SPRING-CRUD

I successfully developed a project using the Spring Boot framework, following its well-structured architectural approach that encompasses various layers. 

This project adhered to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, featuring distinct layers for different functionalities. These layers included the Controller layer, responsible for handling incoming requests and directing them to the appropriate services. The Business Logic layer, where the core operations and logic were implemented, played a pivotal role in ensuring the application's functionality. The Service layer facilitated the interaction between the Controller and Repository layers, encapsulating business logic for easy management. In the Repository layer. 

I leveraged JPA (Java Persistence API) to define a class for Marvel Characters, enabling seamless storage of character names and their associated information. 
For data storage, I opted for the H2 database, a lightweight in-memory database system. 

To streamline project management and dependencies, I wisely chose Maven, incorporating essential dependencies like H2 database, Spring Web, Dev Tools, and JPA. This meticulously designed mini-project empowered CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, showcasing the efficiency and versatility of Spring Boot in modern application development.
